A Baby In The House

    By Ella Wheeler Wilcox



    I knew that a baby was hid in the house;
         Though I saw no cradle and heard no cry,
    But the husband went tiptoeing round like a mouse,
         And the good wife was humming a soft lullaby;
    And there was a look on the face of that mother
    That I knew could mean only one thing, and no other.

    "The mother," I said to myself; for I knew
         That the woman before me was certainly that,
    For there lay in the corner a tiny cloth shoe,
         And I saw on the stand such a wee little hat;
    And the beard of the husband said plain as could be,
    "Two fat, chubby hands have been tugging at me."

    And he took from his pocket a gay picture-book,
         And a dog that would bark if you pulled on a string;
    And the wife laid them up with such a pleased look;
         And I said to myself, "There is no other thing
    But a babe that could bring about all this, and so
    That one is in hiding here somewhere, I know."

    I stayed but a moment, and saw nothing more,
         And heard not a sound, yet I knew I was right;
    What else could the shoe mean that lay on the floor,
         The book and the toy, and the faces so bright?
    And what made the husband as still as a mouse?
    I am sure, very sure, there's a babe in that house.
